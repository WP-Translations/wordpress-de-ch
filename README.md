Introduction
------------
This is a repository for the formal Swiss German WordPress language pack. The original one lives at http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp

New to translate.wordpress.org? Have a look at the Getting Started guide http://translate.wordpress.org/getting-started

gsw.wordpress.org
-----------------
There is a Swiss German Rosetta page at http://gsw.wordpress.org/ from where you can download a Swiss German version of WordPress, but it's in informal language style and not really useful for building serious websites based on WordPress.

de-ch.wordpress.org
-------------------
Does not exist yet, but we'd like it to be created. The translation in the wp-dev-de-ch.po file has already been imported to http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/3.9.x and http://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev which are 100% complete.
