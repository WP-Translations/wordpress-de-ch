Introduction
------------
This is a repository for tracking changes in the formal Swiss German WordPress language pack, i.e. de_CH or German (Switzerland). The informal language pack (Du-Form) is still at 0%, so if you need that for a project, please ping me, then I can explain how the packaging process works.

We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, so therefore the de_CH language pack is based on the de_DE language pack with some minor modifications. We still think it's important that we have our own locale, because we would like to have our own Rosetta site for building the Swiss WordPress community.

de-ch.wordpress.org
-------------------
This is the new Rosetta site at http://de-ch.wordpress.org for the de_CH language pack.

gsw.wordpress.org
-----------------
This is the old Rosetta site at http://gsw.wordpress.org/ for the gws language pack in informal dialect.
