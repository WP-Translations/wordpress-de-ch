Introduction
------------
This is a repository for tracking changes in the formal and informal Swiss German WordPress language packs, i.e. de_CH or German (Switzerland).

We're not trying to reinvent the wheel, so therefore the de_CH language pack is based on the de_DE language pack with some minor modifications. We still think it's important that we have our own locale, because of number formating and of course because of spelling. We also now have our own Rosetta site for building the Swiss WordPress community.

Differences
-----------
- ss instead of ÃŸ
- . instead of , (number_format_decimal_point)
- ' instead of . (number_format_thousands_sep)
- Time zone Europe/Zurich instead of Europe/Berlin
- html_lang_attribute de-CH instead of de-DE

de-ch.wordpress.org

This is the new Rosetta site at http://de-ch.wordpress.org for the de_CH language pack.

gsw.wordpress.org
-----------------
This is the old Rosetta site at http://gsw.wordpress.org/ for the gws language pack in informal dialect.
